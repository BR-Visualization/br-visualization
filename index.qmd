Our working group is committed to making a real-world impact by championing the creation and dissemination of BR visualizations, supporting the adoption of sBRA best practices, and fostering an engaged and informed sBRA community.

## Mission

Our mission is to promote the creation and dissemination of BR visualizations, foster the adoption of best practices in the execution of the sBRA framework, and stimulate conversation within the sBRA community.
